    "### We have been turning during Closed-Loop Control\n",
    "We can get a clue about turning by considering how we did closed-loop control. We perform feedback control of SIXT33N in order to minimize the difference between the two wheels ($\\delta[i] = d_L[i] - d_R[i]$). When perturbations cause one wheel to get ahead of the other resulting in non-zero $\\delta$, feedback control turns the car to correct the error.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's walk through this.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Our feedback control policy is: \n",
    "$$u_L[i] = u_L^{OL} - \\frac{f_L}{\\theta_L}\\delta[i]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$u_R[i] = u_R^{OL} + \\frac{f_R}{\\theta_R}\\delta[i]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say the right wheel has moved further than the left ($d_R[i] > d_L[i]$), resulting in a negative $\\delta[i]$. A negative $\\delta[i]$ results in a reduction of $u_R[i]$, and an increase of $u_L[i]$. But what does this mean physically?\n",
    "\n",
    "If the right wheel is getting ahead of the left one, the left wheel will need to move a little faster and the right wheel a little slower for the wheels to even back out. Thus, feedback control corrects errors by turning to compensate for them.  \n",

    "\n",
    "To turn, we need to manually add some $\\delta_{ref}$ to our $\\delta$ value in every time step during the turn. By doing so, we are tricking our control scheme into thinking that our car has turned by some amount and generated that extra $\\delta_{ref}$ of error, and cause it to turn in the other direction to compensate. Without loss of generality, we'll analyze a right turn, corresponding to adding a **negative** $\\delta_{ref}$ value (we trick the car into thinking it has turned left, so it turns right as \"compensation\"). For a left turn, we simply add in a **positive** $\\delta_{ref}$ instead. Our goal is to generate this $\\delta_{ref}$ from the desired $r$ and $v^*$ for the controller to follow. It will be a function of the controller's time-step, as we want our car to turn gradually, rather than pivot turn.\n",
